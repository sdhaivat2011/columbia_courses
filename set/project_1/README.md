Information Retrieval System
=============================

Description
------------
We need to build a system which can query into a set of documents. For demonstration, we will be using the Cranfield corpus.  
The complete details of the requirements can be found [here](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~cs6998/HW1F13.pdf).  

The documentation for each of the major components is covered in individual README files in each of the folders.  
You can find detailed references on the source code [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~ds3267/IRLib/).  
The project is hosted on [github](https://github.com/sdhaivat2011/columbia_courses/tree/master/set/project_1).
