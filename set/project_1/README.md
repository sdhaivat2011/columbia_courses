Information Retrieval System
=============================

Description
------------
We need to build a system which can query into a set of documents. For demonstration, we will be using the Cranfield corpus.  
The complete details of the requirements can be found [here](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~cs6998/HW1F13.pdf).  

The documentation for each of the major components is covered in individual README files in each of the folders.  
The references for the souce code is generated using doxygen. You can start viewing from docs/index.html.  
Additionally, I will also be hosting the documentation in some time.
