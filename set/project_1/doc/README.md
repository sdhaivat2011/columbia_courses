This folder will contain the documentation generated from code comments using doxygen.  
More information on doxygen and its usage can be found [here](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html).  
Specifically with the current setup, to generate documentation all you need to do is run the following command from the project_1 folder:  
	doxygen Doxyfile  
But for that to run you need to have doxygen setup. Instructions [here](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/install.html).
